#numberic datatypes: int,bool,complex,float
#Sequence number datatypes: list,tuple,string
#set data type: set
#dictionary datatype: dict
# list:
# ex: l = [1,2,3,4]
# note: its a mutable means the data values are chageable/modifiable.

# tuple:
# ex: t = (1,2,3,4)
# note: its immutable
# set:
# note: set doesnt have no index values
#       its un-ordered
#       its a unique
#       we cannot modify the existing value but add/remove
# ex: se = {2,4,1,5}
# DICT: Collection of key,value pairs
# --> keys will be unique
# --> value will be duplicated
# --> its mutable but not the key and values can be changeable
# ex:

# d = { roll: 26, name: 'john', dept: 'cse'}
